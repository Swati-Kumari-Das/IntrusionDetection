# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning  

An intelligent **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** built with **Machine Learning** to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.  
The project leverages the **KDD Cup 1999 dataset** and applies multiple ML algorithms to detect **DoS, R2L, U2R, and Probe attacks** with **99%+ accuracy**.
